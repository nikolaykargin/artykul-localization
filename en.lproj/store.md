# What's New in This Version

In this update, there are no major new features, but some bugs and issues have been fixed, and there's a nice surprise.

You've asked and requested it very often, so we've made it happen. Artykul Infinity - an alternative to the monthly and annual subscription. A one-time payment to gain unlimited access to Artykul forever.

We have also slightly improved the interface behavior on iPad and macOS.

Unfortunately, in this update, the Article-to-Audio feature is temporarily unavailable. We will bring it back as soon as we can.
